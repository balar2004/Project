## Title of the Project
A SMART EXPENSE TRACKING SYSTEM WITH OCR AND CHATBOT  ASSISTANCE

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The "A SMART EXPENSE TRACKING SYSTEM WITH OCR AND CHATBOT ASSISTANCE" is an innovative project designed to solve the common issue of disorganized finances and uncontrolled spending caused by tedious manual expense tracking. The core solution integrates advanced technologies to create an intelligent and automated financial assistant. Users can log expenses effortlessly using multiple methods, including standard text, voice commands, and crucially, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which automatically scans receipts and bills to extract key financial data, significantly reducing manual input and errors.
The intelligence of the system is driven by a custom-built, AI-powered Chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for intent classification and personalized guidance. The system transforms raw data into actionable insights by visualizing spending patterns through dynamic charts and graphs. Furthermore, it maintains financial discipline by proactively sending real-time budget alerts via email, enabling users to gain control over their spending and make smarter financial decisions.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The Smart Expense Tracking System successfully automates the extraction of expense details from receipts using OCR, achieving high accuracy in detecting amounts, dates, and merchant names. This automation significantly reduces manual data entry, speeds up the expense logging process, and ensures better consistency in recorded transactions. The chatbot further enhances user convenience by allowing quick queries, summaries, and insights through simple conversational prompts.

Overall, the system improves personal financial management by providing real-time tracking, organized expense records, and meaningful spending insights. Users gain better control over their budgets, experience faster processing of receipts, and enjoy a more interactive and intelligent way of managing everyday expenses. The solution demonstrates strong potential for real-world use in personal finance apps and small business expense systems.
